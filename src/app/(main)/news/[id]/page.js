          We are pleased to welcome Zaneta Hesch as our official photographer
          for the 2025 IKF Spring Muay Thai and Kickboxing Classic taking place
          this Saturday in Myrtle Beach, SC.
          <br />
          <br />
          Zaneta, who hails from New Bern, North Carolina and trains out of Nine
          Limbs Strikers with Kru Pol and has over a decade of photography
          experience and four years of training in Muay Thai.
          <br />
          <br />
          This opportunity to work with IKF allows her to combine her two
          passions: capturing fighters in the ring and telling their stories of
          discipline and the warrior mindset.
          <br />
          <br />
          The event will be held at the Landmark Resort, with Full Contact
          Action kicking off on Saturday at 1: PM and continuing until around 11
          PM.
          <br />
          <br />
          Additionally, there will be plenty of semi-contact action, including
          IKF Point Muay Thai and Kickboxing Sparring, as well as PBSC Point
          Boxing Sparring and BJJ competitions starting on Saturday evening.
          <br />
          <br />
          Zaneta will be on-site capturing action shots and sharing fascinating
          stories through her photography. Expect to see a wealth of photos
          following the event!
